            Hello Stranger, <br> You couldn't wait any longer to go clubbing, huh?
            Today finally our clubs reopened again, and here you are with
            ants in your pants!<br> Lovely that the post-lockdown brought you to our
            club scene. Known for its exceptional range of attractions and
            vibrancy, Berlin's cultural scene may now blossom back into its old
            colorful beauty.<br> Can you smell the smoke steaming of raves? You're
            probably wondering where the frosty Saturday evening may take you,
            huh?<br>Well... <br> Although the lockdown is finally over, we should still
            care for each other. Look at the masks that belong to the individual
            Clubs in Berlin. It is advisable to wear masks to cover yourself
            from viruses. Maybe they have a surprise or two in store.<br><br>PS. Vaccines can save lives.
